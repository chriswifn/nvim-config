# Configuration
- lazy.nvim
- Treesitter
- Lsp (Mason)
- some other stuff that make life easy

# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chriswifn/nvim-config.git
cd nvim-config
./setup
```
and let `lazy.nvim` download the plugins.
The `setup` file is there because I don't like having git repos in
`.config`.
